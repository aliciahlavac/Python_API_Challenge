# Python_API_Challenge

In this repo, there are two folders. One is VacationPy and the other is WeatherPy.  Each of these folders have a Jupyter Notebook inside them; VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb, respectively. You should run the Jupyter Notebook in WeatherPy first (WeatherPy.ipynb), as VacationPy.ipynb uses data created in WeatherPy.ipynb.  In addition, a folder called output_data should exist outside of the VacationPy and WeatherPy folders, as figures and a .csv file get created there, and VacationPy.ipynb uses data from this folder. 

This project examined the weather and its changes as its location became closer to and further from the equator.  Relationships such as latitude versus temperature, latitude versus humidity, latitude versus cloudiness, and latitude versus wind speed were examined.  Both the Northern and Southern hemispheres were examined. 

It was found that there is a linear correlation between latitude and temperature, with temperatures being higher the closer to the equator the point becomes.  Otherwise, there is no strong linear relationship between the other relationships we examined.

In the next part of this project, we pulled hotels that were close to cities that had ideal weather conditions, and plotted them on a map.  To do this, Geoapify was used, and examined hotels that were within a certain distance from cities that had an ideal weather condition.![2023-06-07](https://github.com/aliciahlavac/Python_API_Challenge/assets/127240852/03ce6242-e3f6-46bd-9a29-70b57aad7067)
